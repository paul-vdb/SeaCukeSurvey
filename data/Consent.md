# The Sea Cucumber Photo Identification Study

### About the Study

The purpose of this study is to discover whether or not the California sea cucumber (*Parastichipous californicus*) is uniquely identifiable 
through images based on their colours and patterns. Sea cucumbers are hard to reliably tag which makes studying them difficult and expensive or unreliable.
Did you know that we currently don't know if a sea cucumber maintains the same colour patterns throughout its lifetime?

We kept 24 sea cucumbers in very comfortable cages in Departure Bay, Nanaimo BC and photographed them 6 times over a year period to test whether or not we could
use their unique colouring and spikes to determine who is who. We would like your help discovering how unique these sea cucumbers are and testing the probability
that they can be correctly identified through time.

This survey is not mandatory and it is up to you to participate. By pressing next down below you are agreeing to participate. If at any point you wish to stop, simply
close the browser and the survey will end with no information saved.

If you wish to participate, we will ask you some background questions about you and your experience with invertebrates. Then we will ask you to match 16 randomly
selected sea cucumbers to different images. It will start by matching the same sea cucumber in the same time period (exact same photo) and then move on to matching
a sea cucumber in different time periods, with the added complication that sometimes, the sea cucumber might not be there at all.

### Will my participation be Anonymous and Confidential?

We will save your results (with no personal information) on a secure server so that we can analyze the data and estimate the 
probability of correctly identifying a sea cucumber.

### What happens afterwards?

The results will be part of a research paper that will be submitted to a scientific journal on photo identification of sea cucumbers.
